HDBSCAN
=======

HDBSCAN - Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications
with Noise. Performs DBSCAN over varying epsilon values and integrates 
the result to find a clustering that gives the best stability over epsilon.
This allows HDBSCAN to find clusters of varying densities (unlike DBSCAN),
and be more robust to parameter selection.

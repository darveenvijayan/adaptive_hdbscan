# Adaptive HDBSCAN
Welcome to the Adaptive HDBSCAN GitHub page! This repository provides an implementation of Adaptive Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN), an algorithm that enables robust and flexible clustering of data.

## Overview
Adaptive HDBSCAN extends the original HDBSCAN algorithm by introducing adaptive parameters that automatically adjust based on the characteristics of the data. This adaptation allows the algorithm to handle diverse datasets effectively. The Prim's algorithm is used instead of the dual tree boruvka for dataset with number of points < 840 (Experimentally determined)
